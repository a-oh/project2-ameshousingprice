Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge




1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model.
2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/t/ff32f6689d5b45aeb23d1441122b7761) to practice the modeling process.
3. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.

You are tasked with creating a machine learning model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is contains over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.




## The Modeling Process

1. The train dataset has all of the columns that you will need to generate and refine your models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that you are trying to predict in your Regression model.
2. Generate your regression model using the training data. We expect that within this process, you'll be making use of:
    - train-test split
    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters
    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables
    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)
3. Predict the values for your target column in the test dataset and submit your predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.
4. Evaluate your models
    - evaluation metrics
    - baseline score
